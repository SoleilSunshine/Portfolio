She provided all the material necessary to give students a comprehensive, baseline understanding of Illustrator\\'s fundamental tools, best practices, shortcuts, theory & applied strategy.While it\\'d take years of practice to develop expertise using the program -- like any professional software -- Kim\\'s workshop offers all of the necessary information to quickly grasp the basic essentials early-on. The gratification that comes from grasping the basics early-on, as a result, empowers & encourages students to build those expert skills later-on through practice (ALOT), heuristics, and trial-and-error.Kim hones in on the program\\'s most salient information, straying away from the more complex features that can bewilder & frustrate users in their developmental stages. [Sidenote: those complex features aren\\'t used that frequently anyway].Topping it all of was Kim\\'s exuberance & enthusiasm -- her pep & vitality made the 7-hour workshop delightful and super easy-to-follow!Any creative workshop led by Kim is not one to miss!Was this review …?UsefulFunnyCoolCody A.Los Angeles, CA0friends13reviewsShare reviewComplimentSend messageFollow Cody A.Stop following Cody A.3/13/2016Updated reviewI\\'d like to add more about life after the program. In January 2016, General Assembly created an Alumni Committee. This committee is handpicked alumni working with GA staff and their task is is to organize events, workshops, and anything else to enhance our community.Since then I\\'ve been able to attend events to help me boost my resume (nice perk for those of us that took the part-time program!), attend fun events like Trivia Night, and there are loads more events coming up.I love how GA listens to students and put something like this together. If you\\'re a current student, or planning to attend soon - definitely get involved and take full advantage of these events. You never know who you\\'re going to meet!Was this review …?Useful3FunnyCool6/15/2015Previous reviewI completed General Assembly\\'s part-time UXD program in Santa Monica in summer 2014, and am a very…I completed General Assembly\\'s part-time UXD program in Santa Monica in summer 2014, and am a very proud alum. To make my review most helpful for future students, I\\'m going to break my review down to three sections: cost, the class, and life after graduation.Cost:- Yeah, $4k for the part-time (weekend) program was a bit scary to me, but in the end, this was an awesome investment for me. Since I\\'ve graduated I\\'ve seen that they\\'ve made it a bit easier for somebody like me to afford the program, so I like the direction they\\'re heading. Would I spend the loot again for another class? Yup, I\\'m hoping to sign-up for another course in the near future!- The Admissions Producer that I was in touch with at the time (Lisa) was awesome! She was incredibly helpful, gave me honest responses to my questions, and went above & beyond to help me through everything. She\\'s an awesome representative of General Assembly, like many others I\\'ve met during my time there.- If you\\'re not sure if this is worth the money to you, attend an intro workshop or two. These give you a great example of what to expect and you\\'ll walk away with learning something new at the same time.The Class:- Weekends and the hours of the class was very convenient for me. I work at a large non-profit organization and my hours are not the typical 9-5 - so this weekend course was perfect for me.- My instructor was somebody that has years of experience and worked at some incredibly successful companies. Like many in the UX field, he was a great mentor and was f*n awesome.- We also had a student aid that was incredibly helpful to us students. He was great at giving us input when working on projects, chimed in during class quite a bit with questions that students weren\\'t asking, and everything else to help us all learn even more.- Classes were jam packed with info and was sometimes overwhelming, but I loved it. For the first hour of class or so we got an introduction of what to expect during our time in the class, got to know each other, and then jumped right in! We completed a number of projects during class and were assigned to work on an app outside of class. All of these projects were real-world projects with real scenarios and look great in my portfolio.- The final day was awesome. We had an incredible guest speaker that gave us some fantastic feedback, answered our questions, and he exceeded all expectations with his visit. This person has been in the industry for a number of years, is a hiring manager, and is somebody that\\'s respected in the industry. He gave us all incredible feedback for how to get a career in UX started and he event stuck around to chat with some of us that had unique questions because of the background we\\'re coming from.- Honestly, I wish I was in class right now and could sit there forever. It was so much fun and an incredible learning experience. I was always early to class and eager to spend all day at GA.- This has nothing to do with the class ... but we got a lot of free food! I\\'m not sure if this is something that happens all the time or not, but it was an awesome surprise. It wasn\\'t every week - but it happened a few times and we were all stoked. (I\\'m vegan and they made sure that there were plenty of options for me, too. Much appreciated.)Life After Graduation:- Did I get a job in the UX field? No. Was it because the program not preparing me for the career switch? Nope. I\\'m not currently a UXD because I decided to stay at my current employer since I was given a promotion. Everything I\\'ve learned at General Assembly has helped with improving every aspect of my job and am forever thankful.- Did others in my class get a UX job? SURE DID. Everybody that I\\'ve kept in touch with landed a UXD position and are doing great in their new roles. There are a few of us from the class that I know for sure that are not currently User Experience Designers and their reasons are the same as mine.- I love the perks. I had credits to be used for workshops at GA and was attending 1 every month for the past number of months. I still attend workshops when I can, and I\\'m aiming to go through the FEWD program early 2016.Was everything perfect at General Assembly? No, but it was still an incredible experience. I have two complaints that I shared with them when I graduated:- The classroom was pretty cramped. I felt like I was rubbing elbows with other students most of the summer and we didn\\'t get much space to move around when working on projects in class. We made the most out of this, but I do wish we had more space to play with.- Although I had a great time on the final day in class, I felt that the \"graduation\" wasn\\'t very exciting. We had a quick \"congrats\" speech at the start of the class, some free gifts, had a great guest speaker, students gave their final presentations, and everybody was taken out for drinks after class. I still enjoyed the day, though.Read moreWas this review …?Useful3FunnyCoolRumala S.Los Angeles, CA128friends10reviewsShare reviewComplimentSend messageFollow Rumala S.Stop following Rumala S.4/19/2016A very cool space to come study the different trades of tech, attend events, and meet people.Was this review …?UsefulFunnyCoolLisandra M.San Francisco, CA30friends11reviewsShare reviewComplimentSend messageFollow Lisandra M.Stop following Lisandra M.8/4/2015I\\'ve been taking workshops at GA for a while and decided finally to start the UX Design immersive course: 10 intensive weeks which I wish could last forever!

I chose Front End Web Development held on Saturdays and it was an incredible experience!Our instruction team (led by Kameron Zach) was awesome. Very creative, insightful and knowledgeable his humor and teaching style was very thorough and welcoming. Shane and Machiko we always available during class or office hours if you had a question or needed more help with concepts as they built from week to week.What I liked most was the give and take between staff and the class -- classes were customized enough to our learning level and our input shaped where the final projects ended. Discussions were very spirited and enjoyable.For those of us who love taking and reviewing notes, classes were available in audio format and each weekend driving down to class, I\\'d listen and review which was an added bonus.TJ (Technical Course Producer) was always available and welcomed us with a welcome lunch and always shared valuable news about the General Assembly experience and how as students you can make the most of resources moving forward.The most fun was seeing everyone\\'s final projects in a class that seemed more like a celebration. It was amazing how far those in class had come and what each person gleaned from instruction. I immediately begged my director for another opportunity.Finally, as a student, you get the type of exposure that could lead to a career opportunities. During our graduation, industry professionals share tips on getting your foot in the door and what steps should take next. Also, student projects can be posted on the General Assembly Gallery @gallery.generalassemb.ly…which allow for feedback, \\xa0sharing and a great link to add to your portfolio or resume.If you\\'re looking for a jump start to your career, I\\'d seriously suggest doing an Full-Time Immersive or time permitting Part-Time Courses.

Better if you work for a company that will sponsor you for this. Otherwise, its a series of bells and whistles and trial by fire learning experience. Best of luck after the program because most companies refuse to even take a chance for an intern position. There are other programs that has the incentive of you dont pay until we get you a job. This does not, only job search resources. If youre an absolute beginner, go through the free resources first and pick peoples\\' brains.

A little history, I had a B.A. in marketing research and was working at the airport to become a commercial pilot. I felt that my creativity was being limited there. I had some knowledge from learning on my own about web design (HTML & CSS) and thought it was fun. Before taking this course I did a lot of research. Google searches, reddit forums etc, I scoured the internet for more information about immersive (bootcamp) style classes. I was first looking at WDI (Web Design Immersive) coding courses at Dev bootcamp, Fullstack Academy, GA and others. (Google the ultimate guide to coding bootcamps and there is an exhaustive list.) I attended my first info session for WDI at GA and thats where I first learned about UXDI. The architects of a website. I took the UX one day workshop and signed up soon after.I quit my job, cleared my mind and went full time on this course. \\xa0Whether I will find an awesome job is still up to fate but I can tell you at this point, I can check off every requirement on a resume that I look at online (other than years of experience). From research, persona, scenario, CCA, MVP\\'s, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing, whatever the topic, I feel confident in the whole UX process. I am skilled with design tools relative to the field. The teachers are amazing as they will be remembered as one of the best and influential. Jill and James have taught me skills beyond the scope of \"knowledge\" and GA is very honest about the program. They constantly bring guest speakers working in the field with varying backgrounds.Learning at GA has been a great deal of fun. Working was intense and I would find myself at school way beyond the 9-5 class schedule. Not that I had to, but because I wanted to. Sure, I was trying to complete projects but it wasn\\'t \"work\" for me. You write on walls and tables making ideas manifest at it\\'s most creative point. Mistakes are encouraged and ideas are iterated with creative people everywhere. Sure times were tough at times but this growing tech field is an exciting movement to be a part of and the people I bump shoulders with are amazing.More articles and studies are being published showing that creativity and soft skills such as empathy and the ability to collaborate, thinking \"outside the box\" are becoming more valuable as automation and AI are becoming more present. The ability to work with others, designing, and creating a positive human experience are essential to the future and this is exactly what this class teaches.I will continue to learn more at GA as subjects including coding, technology and design fascinate me. I am fortunate to be part of the GA community as they are a powerhouse in L.A. as the tech sector is still in it\\'s early stages. Feel free to message me and I would be more than happy to answer any questions, concerns or to just say Hi!Was this review …?Useful11FunnyCoolRahul S.Rancho Palos Verdes, CA0friends7reviewsShare reviewComplimentSend messageFollow Rahul S.Stop following Rahul S.7/21/2015Alright, I took three full courses here and attended over 18 workshops and events so I feel like I can give you a pretty qualified review of the good and bad. It should also be noted that I had very little technical experience coming into this.The three courses I took were User Experience Design (part-time), Sales and Business Development Immersive (full-time) and Web Development Immersive (full-time). Each course obviously had different (very qualified) instructors, and was run differently.The UXD (user experience design) course was my intro to GA. It was on tuesday and thursday nights. The two instructors were very qualified, and I learned a lot in a very short period of time. I would highly recommend this class to those who are looking to transition into tech but aren\\'t quite ready to jump into coding. UXD gives you a pretty good opportunity at learning the ins and outs of turning an app idea into a prototype.The SBDI (sales and business development immersive) course was my first full-time course. We were actually the pilot class for this course in Los Angeles. The main instructor was a Harvard Law School and Y-Combinator/500 Startups alumni. He was great, and the real value in this for me was connecting with people and really learning how to foster those relationships. It was mostly a series of valuable guest speakers. I don\\'t know if they\\'re doing this course any more though. There was less technical learning and more networking.Now the WDI (web development immersive) course is their flagship. This is where I feel like they put most of their efforts. It\\'s designed to take people from not knowing how to code at all to being junior developers that are actually hirable in the field. A lot of people graduated from WDI and got jobs (some of them upwards of six-figures). Others used their coding ability to start entrepreneurial endeavors. GA puts a lot of effort into the outcomes of their students and really helps you get your ducks in a row so you can go out there and get a job if you want to. They even coach you through mock interviews, real interviews, and have you set up your portfolio for meet and hire days where they bring actual companies in to take a look at your work.The WDI course was different for everyone. Personally, I put a lot of effort into the \"pre-work\" (work they give you before you start the course so you can be as prepared as possible to learn) so it was easier for me to pick up concepts in the beginning. By the end of the program, I felt very comfortable learning new languages and solving problems. It\\'s not going to turn you into Mark Zuckerberg in 3 months, but it gives you a strong foundation to continue your coding and become a senior developer eventually.The culture at GA is great. It\\'s very inviting and the staff does everything they can to make sure you\\'re having fun throughout your time there. They\\'re constantly planning happy hours, mixers, paid lunches, guest speakers, panels and field trips. A week doesn\\'t go by when they don\\'t have social events planned. Shout out to Taylor H. for all her hard work!I know it costs more than your typical community college, but you definitely get what you pay for. The only issue I had was parking, which is tough in Santa Monica. Most students just bought a parking pass at a nearby public lot.Was this review …?Useful10FunnyCoolLee R.Playa del Rey, CA13friends50reviewsShare reviewComplimentSend messageFollow Lee R.Stop following Lee R.8/10/2015I\\'m a fairly recent graduate of GA\\'s Web Development Immersive (WDI) program, and would highly recommend it for those interested in a career in Web Development.

I was prepared to be able to utilize the entire UX process in exciting projects (including an actual client project). The takeaways from this program are extremely helpful.My deduction of the 1 star is only for the parking inconvenience. My course was at a temporary location on Broadway at 16th and there were only meters around that area as is much of LA.

For the course I taken I was fortunate enough to have someone who was well educated and have tremendous experienced in the field, I can\\'t say anything for other classes that I have not taken.As of now only time can tell if I will find a job or not, but GA helps you greatly on preparing you for it. They have professionals who will give lectures on what the trend of company that is hiring, will help you 1:1 and help you set your value with skill you have.( I mean who does that right?lol)The school culture is great everyone is so friendly and like a family. If you are hesitant on taking the class my advice to you is take it, I felt the same way before taking the class but almost completing the course I feel great, but don\\'t just rely on GA to hold your hand to the end, because in the end it is what you make of yourself so be prepare!And yes parking might not be great but it is Santa Monica it can never be great so can\\'t blame that on GA.Was this review …?Useful2FunnyCoolKevin G.Santa Monica, CA0friends2reviewsShare reviewComplimentSend messageFollow Kevin G.Stop following Kevin G.8/2/2015Have a few friends that have gone through the Web Development Immersive (WDI in GA-speak) here.

I have always been interested in learning how to code. I started by learning how to make simple webpages while I was in Medical School. After getting done with Medical School I decided to give the tech world a shot and started researching online for coding bootcamps. Most of them required me to already know a fair amount of programming (which I obviously didnt coming straight from Medical School) but GA took me in and taught me from ground up. They sharpened my basics and I learned a fair amount of Advanced JavaScript and Ruby on Rails by the time I was done with their 12 week WDI (Web Development Immersive) course. I made amazing friends here and have worked on multiple projects with them even after Graduation. I got a fair amount of job offers through their meet and hire event as well as the portfolio of projects they helped me build throughout the course. \\xa0If you are keen on learning then this is the place for you. Super awesome instructors and program producers.Best Decision Ever.
